# 02 Advanced CSS: Finn the Flamekeeper – Runekeeping Game Homepage

## Your Task

Welcome to the enchanted homepage of Finn the Flamekeeper’s Runekeeping, a magical game experience that students will build throughout this course!

This project kicks off your coding adventure by combining semantic HTML and advanced CSS to create a visually compelling and responsive landing page for a fantasy web game. It introduces users to Finn—a mythical full-stack dragon developer—and invites them to explore ancient runes, read his legend, and send messages via enchanted raven.

Designed with a focus on layout, responsiveness, and creativity, this homepage sets the stage for future gameplay mechanics and backend features students will add later in the course.

Here’s an example of the GPS (Goal, Problem, Solution) framework from the perspective of a client.

## Goal, Problem & Solution

### Goal

_(One clear sentence that defines what you're trying to accomplish.)_

Create a visually rich and fully responsive homepage for a fantasy-themed runekeeping game, introducing the main character and game concept while preparing a foundation for future features.

### Problem

_(A short paragraph explaining the obstacle that prevents you from reaching the goal. This can include user needs, technical gaps, or design issues.)_

Many introductory game projects focus solely on JavaScript mechanics or back-end logic, overlooking front-end polish. Without an engaging landing page, users may lack context or interest before the game even begins.

### Solution

_(A concise description of how you’ll solve the problem and achieve the goal. This can include features, tools, and techniques you’ll use.)_

Build an immersive, responsive landing page using modern HTML and CSS techniques. This project includes:

A themed header introducing Finn the Flamekeeper, the game’s central character.

Smooth-scrolling navigation to immersive sections like Legend, Runes, Directions, and Send a Raven.

A Rune Gallery built with flexbox and background images to visually represent power-ups or game items.

Responsive layouts using CSS media queries for mobile, tablet, and desktop play.

Semantic HTML structure to lay the foundation for accessibility and SEO as the project evolves.

This homepage is the first milestone in a full-stack game development journey.
